---- Milestone 1: Standing ----

Train
```
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Isaac-Nav-Go2-v0 --headless
```

Watch
```
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/play.py --task=Isaac-Nav-Go2-v0 --video --video_length 200
```
(Rename and save the video to the Google Drive)


---- Milestone 2: Drunk walking ----

In class NavCommandsCfg, change this part as specified for Milestone 2:
